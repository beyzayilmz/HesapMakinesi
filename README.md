# Calculator & Quadratic Equation Solver

A stylish web-based calculator and quadratic equation solver with a Lana Del Rey themed interface created by **Beyza Yılmaz**.



## Features

### 🧮 Advanced Calculator
- **Basic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- **Advanced Functions**:
  - Square Root (√)
  - Cube Root (∛)
  - Power/Exponentiation (xⁿ)
  - Factorial (x!)
  - Reciprocal (1/x)
  - Percentage (%)
  - Pi (π) constant
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard input support for faster calculations
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Hata!" (Error) for invalid operations

### 📐 Quadratic Equation Solver
- Solves equations in the form: **ax² + bx + c = 0**
- Handles all cases:
  - Two real roots (discriminant > 0)
  - One real root (discriminant = 0)
  - Complex roots (discriminant < 0)
- Real-time calculation with form submission
